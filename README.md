# Shadow

Shadow tracks your click speed over time and reports it in a file for your viewing pleasure

---
### *How does it work?*

Simple - every few seconds (5), the program prints to the screen your Clicks Per Second during that time period. Any CPS below 3 will be removed. After 30 seconds, the program will log the last 30 seconds (rather, active 30 seconds) to `~/Documents/ShadowClick/data.txt`

To run, you will need to download [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/).

Thanks for using my programs!
